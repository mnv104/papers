\section{Hypervisor Shortcut IO}
\label{sec:integration}

\begin{notes}
  Shortcut IO. For 4k blocks with high ref counts, let's try to do shortcut IO.
  Idea is that whenever such a block is read in first, we do page tracking for it
  and ask page sharing to share that page. Subsequent reads to that page can then be 
  satisfied directly from the shortcut tracked 'cache'.

  We can prototype this fairly quickly by allocating up a kernel anon page and then
  mem copying into it the contents of the predicted highly referenced page. Then provide
  an explicit hint to our page sharing to attempt to share those two pages.

  We've always wanted to try out the VDI shortcut i/o idea in context of dedup. Now is our
  chance. If we can prototype this, I think our paper gets in for sure! :) --irfan
